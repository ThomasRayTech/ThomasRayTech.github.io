This probably sounds ridiculous, knowing my family and background, but my opinions on the treatment of animals may be changing

I still think that any and every edible creature on this earth is good to eat for humans. But I'm considering the way I've thought about my fellow creatures lately.

And quite frankly? It's cruel. It's inconsiderate. And a cold kind of dispassionate dismissal of life that differs from how I value my own..

For a while now, since a few years ago, learning Computer Science and enjoying robotics advancements have affected my view of animals. Influenced also by some possibly questionable traditions that ignored biblical foundation, or the heart of texts.

I thought to myself like this:
1. Humans are told they are special to God. Created in a unique way.
2. Humans are told animals are not sufficient company.
3. Humans  later given authority to eat any and every creature.
4. Animals were also offered continually as sacrifice.

Misunderstanding this. with a much darker meaning, and applying what I learned from computer science,  I saw creatures as simply black boxes for programs beyond my understanding.

I looked at them, and through the lens of my theology I saw creatures that had no soul like I did. I saw forms and figures that were interesting. That spoke of God's craft as an architect and engineer, but not creatures with experience. Only neuron-and-flesh machines, their responses a simulacra of our true experiences.

How cruel is that? I don't need to understand or illustrate the point for you. I hope you can simply perceive that that is wrong.

I thought their life was of *less* value because they were sacrifices and food for us. But a sacrifice worth making, by definition, has to be something of *value*.

I read a couple of articles, which are likely put together more effectively than this quick note will be, and more thoughtfully, and I won’t do the work of linking you to all the verses, but from a Biblical standpoint where I actually consider and ponder what I’m being told by the text, and not the traditions which formed around it? God’s love of all his creations is affirmed often. The planet is anthropomorphically described as groaning because of our wrongness, waiting for us to be redeemed so animals will exist in their normal state again.

Actually considering that, we are the only creatures in existence that if God commands, we may disobey. God speaks through a donkey. Commands animals as tools of plagues. Feeds the birds. Disciplines arrogance in humanity (there’s a story with a bear that kills some mocking young people). Even inanimate objects in creation are described as listening to orders better than us.

Not to over praise animals or creation. But, speaking from personal experience, there’s a notion of inflated self-importance of humans in relation to animals. It’s the same thing God warns the gentiles who are being “grafted in” from doing to the Jews who were cut off. We get lifted up, and instead of being thankful, a wrong notion is allowed that we deserve it in some manner (we explicitly are told we do not deserve more than punishment).

Basically I’m saying I’m coming to terms with the cruel way I’ve thought of animals, and perhaps treated them, in the past. I may not show pre-serial killer tendencies in cruelty to mammals or other critters like causing harm, but really in evaluating these things I remember flicking an insect or two, not because it bothered me or posed any harm, but just to laugh at it careening off in the distance.

There’s something morbid to that. There’s also something morbid to the cold detachment I have to *food* animals and pests, and the on/off switch of care I throw up for non-food animals as composed to these other groups. There’s alot of times I’ve expressed outright hatred of spiders, roaches, or snakes. I would never express this of dogs, or even squirrels, so why do I feel safe to do otherwise for these animals? Even Snakes, the creature that gets the baddest rap of all in the bible, when it was punished was not utterly destroyed. God obviously still valued its existence

I guess I got here from trying to think on self-defense from Biblical perspective. There’s verses that describe one’s right to life, and one's right to defend that life and their property. To extend a connecting thought between the two subjects, if you can defend yourself without killing the attacker, most moral and merciful people would advise to do so. Why would this be different from a pest?

Or if I can make the picture more graphic for illustration and effect's sake, when killing an animal for food (an allowed practice, once in Genesis, and again later in Acts) which of either of these morally reprehensible:

-Killing the animal swiftly, and as painlessly as possible.
-Or cutting the animal slowly?

Do I need to clarify that thought experiment? Because I don’t think I do. I think most people would look at me, even seasoned hunters with several bucks, bears, or hogs under their belt, and know that anyone who slowly and tortuously killed an animal has something wrong inside them. There is a visible desire in such a case to inflict pain on a life. It’s unnerving and uncomfortable to confront.

But then, if I were to extend this thought, and say it applies as equally to the pests you hate, such as to insects, as to large mammals, I may receive backlash. It’s stupid right?

But I am made to consider the biblical warnings of Psalms and Proverbs against favoritism, or crooked weights. The symbolism of those verses teach the danger of not applying what is just equally across the board. 

So yes,  I will probably kill the next Water Moccasin or Black Widow I see. But this *must* be only for my safety. *Only* Because I have a responsibility to my own life, and to protect others. In the same way I have a responsibility to protect my kitties from hawks and my chickens from foxes (My mom takes care of chickens and kittens back home, it’s a regular Old McDonald scene down there). If I’m in authority over someone or some creature, because of occupational status or general human status as caretaker, I’m also responsible for exercising that authority correctly.

No one wants a cop who doesn’t protect people when something bad goes down. Or a cop who is drunk on power.

I am thinking as I write this of how it relates to other world beliefs of animals. I’ve taken to saying a phrase in less PC places, where the people I’m with know my heart, and I don’t have to worry that what I say will be taken out of context. The prase is this: *“The best lies have sprinkles of truth in them.”* 

In accepting certain Biblical statements of the sole Godhood of Christ, I have, by nature of accepting this truth, rejected what is called truth in other beliefs. In accepting this biblical truth and refusing others, it follows I refute the validity of alot of other religious beliefs in general. But that phrase I use is meant, as best it can be received (because I no doubt will cause offense just by  nature of the reality that I reject another's beliefs) to confirm that I do not disagree wholly.

In fact I consider that there are likely many mutual truths I could be in agreeance with others on, despite larger theological disputes.

It's not popular to say so, but I consider that's actually why most religions are successful. If it follows that Biblical truth is the only correct explanation of spiritual reality, and that the Devil is considered Father of lies and intends to mislead as many as possible, and that the most effective lies are half-truths, this would be the case of most religions.

I consider a good case of presenting this gently is Paul to the Roman Athenians, when he addresses them concerning the Christian God they didn't yet know: ‘For in him we live and move and have our being.’ As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are his offspring.’ Acts 17:28

Paul didn’t dismiss the art, culture, or poetry of Athens simply because the people did not know the God Paul spoke of. He used their language, lovingly, to show who they were really writing about. Who their pantheons and beliefs were approximating.

In this way I hope to honor, and not diminish other religions in the world. They are, in a manner, noble searches for truth. 

My own experience as a Christian has been an arduous year-by-year of coming to realizations where I’ve been wrong. Of debate between principle, interpretation, context, history, and schisms of believers and how that effects how I should live my life.

But I’ve come to see *the* truth is in Jesus. And moreso, that I simply cannot mince words on that, I cannot apologize for Jesus being the only way to peace, or for him being the only God. The only one who made us. 

Discussion of weights comes up often in the Bible, sometimes in reference to a spiritual plumbline, sometimes to the concept of fairness and equality. In keeping with it, I mention that the measure for the kilogram is the International Prototype Kilogram. It is what a the conceptual kilogram is measured up against in practical reality for accuracy. So too, I propose, is existence, truth,  and reality measured by the one who maintains that existence, its creator, Christ.

So from that, I say this, somehow having lost track and trying to return to the topic of animals: Perhaps Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism in their universal respect for life, or secular vows of non-aggression, are perceptive of this truth, of the value of all created life. 

This is truly a seed of truth worth appreciating when trying to consider the whole.
